## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Prioritize deterministic room/team reliability before deeper gameplay work.
- [Phase 2]: Enforce canonical lifecycle and breach outcomes immediately after lobby stability.
- [Phase 3]: Route all gameplay mutations through validated build queue paths.

### Pending Todos

From `.planning/todos/pending/` - ideas captured during sessions.

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Canonical breach-rule wording must stay consistent across server events, UI status, and tests.
- Room capacity and overflow handling should be finalized before lobby hardening is considered complete.
